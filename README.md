# Euclidean Distance Calculator

This project is a simple Python script that calculates the Euclidean distance between pairs of points in a 2D space. The Euclidean distance is the "straight-line" distance between two points, commonly used in mathematics and computer science for spatial calculations.

This project is also a solution for a task provided in the **IBM & Kodluyoruz: CyberStart** training program.

## Task Description

The Euclidean distance is the "straight-line" distance between two points, commonly used in mathematics and computer science for spatial calculations. This project demonstrates how to use Python functions and loops to calculate distances between points in 2D space.

### Task Requirements:
1. **Define Points**: Create a list called `points` containing tuples, where each tuple represents a point `(x, y)` in 2D space.
2. **Function for Euclidean Distance**: Write a function called `euclideanDistance` that takes two tuples (each representing a point) and returns the Euclidean distance between them.
3. **Calculate Distances**: Use a loop to calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of points in the `points` list, and store these distances in a separate list called `distances`.
4. **Find Minimum Distance**: Find and print the minimum distance from the `distances` list.


## Features

- **Define Points**: Allows you to define a list of points in 2D space.
- **Distance Calculation**: Includes a function to compute the Euclidean distance between any two points using the Pythagorean theorem.
- **Minimum Distance**: Calculates and displays the minimum distance between any two points in the list.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/begumzafer/Euclidean-Distance-Calculator.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  example: cd euclidean_distance_calculator

3. Run the main.py script in a Python environment:
   python main.py
   
4. Modify the list of points in the script as needed, and the program will output the minimum Euclidean distance between point pairs.

### Example
For a list of points such as [(1, 2), (4, 6), (7, 8), (2, 3), (5, 9)], the script will calculate all distances between point pairs and display the shortest one.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
